I am Rex Liu, a second-year student in the Master of Science in [Computational Finance](https://www.cmu.edu/mscf/) (MSCF) program at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. I earned my Master's in [Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/graduate/ms-gsas/ms-mathematics/) from New York University's (NYU) Courant Institute, where I also completed my undergraduate degree in [Honors Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/ba-cas/majors-minors/honors-programs/#honors-math-major) with minors in [Computer Science](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/minor_programs.html) and [Cinema Studies](https://tisch.nyu.edu/cinema-studies) at the Tisch School of the Arts.
