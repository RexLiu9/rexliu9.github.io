I am Rex Liu, an MSc student in [mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/graduate/ms-gsas/ms-mathematics/) at Courant Institute, NYU. Previously as an undergraduate student, I majored in [honors math](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/ba-cas/majors-minors/honors-programs/#honors-math-major) and minored in [computer science](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/minor_programs.html) at Courant as well as [cinema studies](https://tisch.nyu.edu/cinema-studies) at NYU Tisch.

My potential research interest lies in probability theory and applications. Currently, I'm working on my Master's thesis advised by [Prof. Jonathan Goodman](https://math.nyu.edu/~goodman/), about the convergence of Markov chains and Markov chain Monte Carlo. I have been doing a reading with Jianliang Ye, advised by [Prof. Ofer Zeitouni](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~zeitouni/), focusing on stochastic interface models (random surfaces, cluster swapping, surface tensions) in Fall 2023, and another reading independently, advised by [Prof. Fedor Bogomolov](https://math.nyu.edu/people/profiles/BOGOMOLOV_Fedor.html), focusing on topological graph theory (graph embedding on surfaces, Heawood conjecture, and the four-color theorem) in Summer 2022. I joined the [Ross](https://rossprogram.org/) math camp studying number theory in Summer 2019.

Other interests: cinema studies, culinary arts, and paleontology. Here is my [curriculum vitae](https://rexliu9.github.io/files/academic_cv_Feb24.pdf).
