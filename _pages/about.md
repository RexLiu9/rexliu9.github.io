I am Rex Liu, an incoming student in the Master of Science in Computational Finance (MSCF) program at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. I am currently completing my Master’s degree in [Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/graduate/ms-gsas/ms-mathematics/) at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. During my undergraduate studies at Courant, I pursued a major in [Honors Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/undergrad/ba-cas/majors-minors/honors-programs/#honors-math-major) and a minor in [Computer Science](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/minor_programs.html), alongside a minor in [Cinema Studies](https://tisch.nyu.edu/cinema-studies) at the Tisch School of the Arts.

### Research
I'm working on my Master's thesis advised by [Prof. Jonathan Goodman](https://math.nyu.edu/~goodman/), about the convergence of Markov chains and Markov chain Monte Carlo. Previously I have been doing a reading advised by [Prof. Fedor Bogomolov](https://math.nyu.edu/people/profiles/BOGOMOLOV_Fedor.html), focusing on topological graph theory (graph embedding on surfaces, Heawood conjecture, and the four-color theorem) in Summer 2022. I joined the [Ross](https://rossprogram.org/) math camp studying number theory in Summer 2019.
